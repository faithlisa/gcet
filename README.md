# Report on the GCET Project

## Introduction
The "Global CO2 Emissions From Transport (GCET)" project is an initiative aimed at visualizing the carbon dioxide emissions from the transport sector across various countries over a span of years. The primary objective of this project is to provide an interactive and informative platform that helps stakeholders understand and analyze the impact of transport-related CO2 emissions on the environment and public health.

## Target Users
The GCET project is designed for a diverse group of users, including:
1. **Ministry of Transport of Individual Countries**: To help policymakers and government bodies make informed decisions to mitigate CO2 emissions from transport.
2. **Transport Associations (e.g., AET)**: To aid associations in advocating for sustainable transport policies.
3. **Health Sector**: To provide data that links transport emissions to public health concerns.
4. **Researchers**: To offer a reliable dataset for academic and scientific research related to environmental studies and public health.

## User Goals and Tasks
Users of the GCET project aim to achieve the following goals:
- **Visualize CO2 Emissions**: View the global distribution of CO2 emissions from transport on an interactive map.
- **Analyze Trends**: Examine the trends in CO2 emissions over different years and identify patterns or anomalies.
- **Upload Custom Data**: Import and visualize their own datasets to see how their data compares with global trends.
- **Inform Policy and Research**: Use the visualized data to support policy-making, research, and advocacy for reduced CO2 emissions.

## Tools and Frameworks Used
The GCET project leverages several tools and frameworks to achieve its functionality:
- **D3.js**: For creating dynamic and interactive data visualizations.
- **HTML/CSS**: To structure and style the web interface.
- **JavaScript**: For adding interactivity and handling user inputs.
- **Python (for data processing)**: To generate and manipulate dataset for visualization.
- **GitHub**: For version control and project collaboration.

## Evaluation
### What Could Have Been Done Better
- **Enhanced Interactivity**: More interactive features could be added to allow users to compare data between different countries directly on the map.
- **Data Validation**: Implementing more rigorous data validation mechanisms to ensure the accuracy of custom data uploaded by users.
- **Performance Optimization**: Optimizing the performance of the visualization, especially for large datasets, to ensure smooth user experience.

### Further Ideas That Could Be Implemented
- **Advanced Analytics**: Integrate advanced analytics tools to provide deeper insights into the data, such as forecasting future emissions trends.
- **Mobile Compatibility**: Enhance the design to be fully responsive and compatible with mobile devices.
- **API Integration**: Allow integration with external APIs to automatically update the dataset with the latest available data.

### Difficulties Faced
- **Data Collection**: Gathering comprehensive and accurate data for all countries was challenging.
- **Handling Large Datasets**: Managing and visualizing large datasets required significant optimization to ensure performance was not compromised.
- **User Interface Design**: Designing an intuitive and user-friendly interface that caters to a diverse group of users was complex.

### Alternatives and Compromises Made
- **Simplified UI**: To ensure usability, some advanced features were omitted from the initial release.
- **Static Data Set**: Initially used a static dataset to simplify the development process, with plans to incorporate real-time data updates in future versions.

## Conclusion
The GCET project successfully provides a platform for visualizing and analyzing CO2 emissions from the transport sector globally. It serves as a valuable tool for policymakers, researchers, and transport associations to understand and mitigate the environmental impact of transport emissions. Despite some limitations and challenges, the project lays a strong foundation for future enhancements and broader application.
